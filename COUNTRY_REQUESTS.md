## Map With AI Country Requests

This page tracks country requests for RapiD support from the OSM community. Crossed items correspond to countries that we have already rolled out.

If you would like to get RapiD support for a new country, please [create an issue](https://github.com/facebookincubator/RapiD/issues) in our repo. That will help us prioritize our rollout plan. Happy mapping!
